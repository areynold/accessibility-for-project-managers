# Project Manager Presentation

Available Time: 40 minutes

## Intro

* Presentation goals
    * Role of PM
    * 11 requirements (flash card knowledge), POUR
    * How to acquire the knowledge/expertise you need within your team (or who to contact)
    * How to tell when youâ€™ve met the requirements
        * No regulatory body, per se
        * Examine some past court cases
    * How to include accessibility into the project flow (not a line item; not something you have to know everything about)

## Role of PM

* Be aware of the state of the project at all times
* Minimize risk (legal, functional, reputation)
* Ensure smooth process
* Be able to answer questions with a high degree of certainty

## How to do that?

* No surprises!
    * Identify project requirements (legal, functional)
    * Tease out fuzzy requirements (implied functionality, poorly defined specs)
* Communicate requirements to team
* Communicate progress to stakeholders
* *Not* responsible for implementation
    * Understand rules of thumb

## Requirements gathering

* Treat accessibility requirements as any other UI requirement
    * Minimum functional requirements
    * Mostly non-functional requirements--app won't break, but user experience will be poor
* Your process will establish due diligence
    
## Legal Requirements

* All electronic products produced or procured for the U of I subject to section 508.
    * Must be accessible to persons with disabilities
    * Alternate arrangements must be made when content cannot be made accessible

## Legal requirements are fuzzy

* Lots of room for (mis)interpretation
    * Lots of outdated advice
    * Lots of legal ambiguity
    * One-size-fits-all is not feasible
    * 100% coverage is unrealistic. 

## Functional Requirements

* What are you building?
    * Accessible output vs. accessible authoring tools for accessible output
    * Ignore requirements for components you aren't using
* What has the customer asked for?
    * Some components, frameworks have known accessibility challenges
* How much control do you have?
    * Third-party software may require changes

## Functional requirements are fuzzy

* Some specs and support defined by language, wcag, tools
* Big gap between meeting minimum functional requirements and meeting user expectations
* At some point, accessibility becomes usability
    * Accessibility/usability split makes a good threshold for minimum viable product
* Users are not monolithic--no substitute for user testing

## Where does accessibility fit in?

* Everywhere
* Accessibility is not a single checkbox item
* Accessibility is easy to start doing
* Accessibility is easy to undo
* Consider accessibility from the beginning and throughout the process

## What can you do?

## Get to know your team

* Identify existing expertise and interest
* Appoint an expert if necessary--QA often a good choice
* Watch out for bottlenecks on critical personnel
* Allow time to learn the tools!

## Share knowledge

* Come prepared with resources
* Anticipate role-based concerns
    * Designers likely to feel hobbled
    * Developers likely to be unsure what they need to implement 

## Get to know your project

* Know your users
* Spend more time in the design phase
    * Play out use cases
    * Identify project elements and associated requirements/challenges
    * Identify sweet spot to begin implementing UI, which is especially sensitive to accessibility issues
* Spend time on process
    * Identify intake and prioritization heuristics
    * Develop use cases and personas
    * Identify supported technologies
    * Identify canonical guides

## Show your work

* Get QA involved early!
* Get user feedback early!
* Follow your checklists

## Build Your Skills

* Learn legal requirements
* Learn WCAG 2.0 success criteria (a, aa, aaa)
    * aa generally a safe, achievable choice
    * aaa good goal, but may be impossible to achieve on all pages
    * User content can fail a formerly accessible site
* Learn to recognize 11 requirements (Images, keyboard operability, forms, document structure, magnification, reading order, links & navigation, multimedia, tables, color & styles, aria)
* Learn to apply POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust)
* Understand accessibility/usability spectrum
    * Disabilities can range from mild to severe
    * Disabilities can be temporary
    * Users with disabilities are not monolithic
    * Users with disabilities are regular people
* Don't need to know everything
