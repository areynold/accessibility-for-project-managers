# Accessibility for Project Managers

Presenters: Andrew Reynolds, Bryan Jonker  
Session Length: 40 minutes

---

## Presentation Goals

High level understanding of how PMs can incorporate accessibility into project timeline

---

## Not covered

Specific project management methodologies

(Join us monthly at Explore With Hadi)

---

## What is the PM's role?

* Be aware of the state of the project at all times
* Minimize risk (legal, functional, reputational)
* Ensure smooth development process and handoff
* Be able to answer questions with a high degree of certainty

---

## How do we meet those needs?

---

### Minimize surprises!

* Identify project requirements (functional, technical, regulatory)
* Tease out fuzzy requirements (implied functionality, poorly defined specs)

---

### Facilitate communication

* Communicate requirements to team and/or vendors
* Communicate progress to stakeholders

---

Project Manager is *not* responsible for implementation  
Understand rules of thumb, not the gory details

---

## What does that have to do with accessibility?

---

## Treat accessibility as any other UI requirement

* Include functional requirements in minimum viable product
* Watch non-functional requirements for enhancement or regression--app won't break, but UX will be poor
* Reference external documents (e.g., WCAG) and document any exceptions

---

* Accessibility is an inherent part of a product, just like usability, performance, and security
* Accessibility is not a single checkbox item
* Accessibility is easy to start doing, but difficult to add at the end of the project
* Accessibility is easy to undo

---

Your process will establish due diligence

---

## Project Manager Knowledge Requirements

---

## Don't need to know everything

Lots of campus resources available. Use them!

---

### Regulatory Requirements

Federal, state, and university legal and policy requirements

(This is WCAG 2.0 AA for university employees)

---

### Success criteria

Learn high level differences between WCAG 2.0 success criteria (a, aa, aaa)

* Implementation requirements
* Handoff and client responsibilities

---

### Applied Knowledge and Triggers

---

Learn to recognize 11 requirements that should trigger accessibility check

(Images, keyboard operability, forms, document structure, magnification, reading order, links & navigation, multimedia, tables, color & styles, aria)

---

Learn to apply WCAG POUR principles

(Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust)

---

Understand accessibility/usability spectrum

* Disabilities can range from mild to severe
* Disabilities can be temporary
* Users with disabilities are not monolithic
* Users with disabilities may use your product in ways you hadn't considered
* Users with disabilities are regular people

---

## Diving in: Requirements Gathering

---

### Regulatory Requirements

All electronic products produced or procured for the U of I subject to section 508

* Must be accessible to persons with disabilities
* Alternate arrangements must be made when content cannot be made accessible

---

### Implementation of Regulatory Requirements

* Section 508 will mandate WCAG 2.0 Level AA as of January, 2018
* IT Accessibility policy will require WCAG 2.0 Level AA for web technologies as of Fall 2017
* OBFS requires WCAG 2.0 Level AA for purchase of web services and technologies
* Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act will be refreshed on July 18, 2017 to mandate WCAG 2.0 Level AA as well

---

### The good

Requirements better defined than they used to be

---

### The not so good

* Still hard to google a clear line item standard
* Devil is in the details
    * Lots of outdated advice
    * Sometimes legal ambiguity
    * One-size-fits-all is not feasible
    * Best practices can be in conflict

---

### Legal Takeaways

Be prepared with sources!

---

### Functional Requirements

---

**What are you building?**

* Accessible output vs. accessible authoring tools for accessible output
* Ignore requirements for components you aren't using

---

**What has the customer asked for?**

(Some components, frameworks have known accessibility challenges)

---

**How much control do you have?**

(Third-party software may require changes)

---

### Aside: Stakeholder Requests

Accessibility is similar to other non-functional requirements like security.

---

Stakeholders often ask for accessibility but only in general terms.  
Stakeholders do see the impact of poor implementation.

---

Be prepared to talk accessibility

* Regulatory stick
* Carrots
    * Better SEO
    * More robust, flexible product
    * Better usability
    * Better customer retention/market
* Back up your statements

---

### Functional Takeaways

Some specs and support defined by WCAG, language, tools

---

At some point, accessibility becomes usability

* Matt King - "Functional accessibility"
* Accessibility/usability split makes a good threshold for minimum viable product
* Make sure you don't mix up "this will inconvenience the user" and "this disenfranchises the user"

---

Big gap between meeting minimum functional requirements and meeting user expectations

* e.g., Don't map ctrl+c to close window.
* Assistive technologies have their own conventions

---

No substitute for user testing

Users are not monolithic.  
Users have their own preferences, which may not be obvious to users without disabilities

---

### Requirements Wrapup

* Determine *all* of your requirements
* Determine how accessibility requirements map to functional requirements
* Document everything you've learned
* Make that documentation internally available to your team

---

## Facilitate inclusion of accessibility

Understand that accessibility breaks down when people start guessing

---

As a team, commit to accessibility as a requirement

* Enlist existing expertise and interest
* Appoint a liaison to accessibility experts if necessary
    * QA often a good choice

---

## Gotchas

* Watch out for bottlenecks on critical personnel
* Plan for a learning curve (e.g., screenreaders)
    * Identify external resources and communicate to team
    * Obtain/offer accessibility training where appropriate

---

## Share knowledge

* Come prepared with resources
* Build a common understanding of accessibility inside your project team
* Make sure project standards are readily available

---

### Anticipate role-based concerns

* Designers likely to feel hobbled
* Developers likely to be unsure what they need to implement
* Content providers likely to be unaware that they have a role

---

## Get to know your project

Know your users. 
Understand who you're developing for.

---

### Spend more time in the design phase

* Play out use cases and user personas (and personas of users with disabilities)
* Identify project elements and associated requirements/challenges
* Identify sweet spot to begin implementing UI, which is especially sensitive to accessibility issues

---

## Spend time on process

* Identify intake and prioritization heuristics--regulatory requirements are not enhancements
* Develop use cases and personas
* Identify supported technologies
* Identify canonical guides

---

### Establish Processes to Minimize Risk

Accessibility is especially vulnerable to regression

* Include accessibility in an iterative fashion. Don't just test at the end of the lifecycle
* Automate accessibility testing when possible
* Follow your checklists

---

### Revisit your assumptions

Different user groups may have competing needs

* Get QA and your accessibility experts involved early!
* Get user feedback early!
* Discuss accessibility in project retrospective session(s) and check-ins

---

## Hold your vendors accountable

* Use the Accessibility Requirements for Procured Software v1.7 document as a reference. 
* Be prepared to work with vendors that aren't familiar with accessibility requirements. 
    * This may mean finding other vendors

---

* Make sure accessibility requirements are communicated to the vendor
* Make sure accessibility requirements are included in the contract
    * Need to include remediation clause ("if it doesn't meet X, then it will be added on an agreed-upon time")
* Check for Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) from the vendor
* Determine the vendor's point of contact to handle accessibility issues

---

## How do you know you're done

Just like any other requirement

---

### Homework == Success!

Because you've prioritized your requirements, you know what needs to be finished.

---

* Release because you've met the project's defined requirements
* Release because you've hit a hard deadline
* Release because you need feedback from the user

---

## How do you hand off the finished product

* Document the specs you met (refer to WCAG 2.0 guidelines)
* Document areas where enhancements or remediations are needed

---

### Prepare the customer

Changing content may invalidate site accessibility  
(Refer to WCAG 2.0)

---

## Consider creating a VPAT

Especially useful if working with other higher ed institutions
